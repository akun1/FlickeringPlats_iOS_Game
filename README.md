# FlickeringPlats_iOS_Game
The player tilts the device to move the ball side to side and taps anywhere to make the ball jump.
Every time the player hits any platform (top, bottom or sides), the ball can jump again. 
The green line is the highest elevation reached, essentially the player's score.
If the ball goes below the red line, the game is over.
As the player's elevation increases, the game gets harder by changing the number of platforms, their speed, the jump power of the ball, the distance between the ball and red line, etc. 

Design of game was inspired by minimalism.

Created using Swift 3.
